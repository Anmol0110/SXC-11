Nepal's dog chew exports surged by 27.82 percent in the first half of the current fiscal year due to growing international demand. According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 963 tonnes of dog chews worth Rs1.80 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year ending in mid-January. The United States was the largest importer, taking in 852 tonnes valued at Rs 1.59 billion, followed by Canada with 56 tonnes worth Rs130.34 million. The United Kingdom imported 11 tonnes valued at Rs30.35 million, while Japan received 8 tonnes worth Rs 18.52 million. Manufacturers and exporters report that 90 percent of Nepal's dog chew production is exported, with only a small portion consumed locally by people. Due to the high cost, Nepalis generally do not feed these chews to their pets.
